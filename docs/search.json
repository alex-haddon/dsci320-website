    "text": "This dataset is a record of all traffic stops in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, United States in 2005 and 2015. Charlotte is the capitol and largest city in North Carolina, and is a major urban population center in the United States. The dataset records the date, time, and location of the traffic stop; the age, sex, and ethnicity of the driver; the reason for the traffic stop, including suspicion of drugs, weapons, or illegal activity; whether the car was searched and if anything was found; and whether a citation or warning was issued, or an arrest was made. The raw data comes as separate files for each city center, which must be combined into a cohesive dataset. The raw data is much too large for Altair to handle with nearly 4 million observations between the years of 2000 and 2015, so we have taken a random sample of 400,000 observations between 2010 and 2015 for our analysis.\n\n\n\nThe dataset comes from the Stanford Open Policing Project (SOPP), available here. The project was created to improve transparency and enable research on racial disparities in police traffic stops across the United States.\nTo build this dataset, the SOPP team filed hundreds of public records requests to state and local law enforcement agencies under Freedom of Information laws. Millions of individual traffic stop records were gathered and standardized across jurisdictions to ensure consistent variable names. The data was collected to analyze, document, and share patterns of policing behavior, so researchers, journalists, and policymakers could be informed on how disparities occur."
